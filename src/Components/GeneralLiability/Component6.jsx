            The primary difference between Public Liability Insurance and Commercial General Liability (CGL) insurance is the risks they cover. Public Liability Insurance provides financial coverage against the public’s claims against your business for personal injury or property damage. CGL is a more accessible form of insurance that provides a more extensive range, covering personal and advertising injuries and everything public liability covers.
