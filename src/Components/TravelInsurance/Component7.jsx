            Travel insurance is coverage designed to protect against risks and
            financial losses that could happen while traveling. The risks range
            from minor inconveniences such as delayed or lost bags and trip
            cancellations, to medical emergencies while outside your province of
            residence or Canada.

            limitations and exclusions apply depending on where you are
            travelling or if you have a pre-existing medical condition. Please
            refer to your policy for a complete description of coverage and
            exclusions and talk to your broker if you have any questions.

            In general, most provinces consider pickup trucks to be commercial
            motor vehicles if they are used for commercial or business purposes.
            However, check with your provincial transportation ministry to
            determine if your pickup truck is classified as a commercial
            vehicle.

            When you apply to get travel insurance, your broker will ask you if
            you have any pre-existing conditions. Having a pre-existing
            condition does not mean that you cannot be covered, however, it
            could limit your coverage for medical emergencies if your condition
            in not stable.

              In fact, before leaving on a trip, your condition must be stable
              based on a series of factors defined in a stability clause in
              order to be covered. If you have a pre-existing condition and if
              you have any questions, let your broker know.

          <div className="bg-[#F5F5F5] text-sm p-5 rounded-2xl">
          In general, travel insurance to Canada costs about 3 – 10% of your total prepaid and non-refundable trip expenses. The cost of travel insurance depends on two factors for Travel Protection plans: 
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
              <li><b>Total Trip cost:</b> The total non-prepaid and non-refundable costs you have already paid for your upcoming trip. This includes prepaid excursions, plane tickets, cruise costs, etc.</li>
              <li><b>Age: </b> Like any other insurance type, the correlation is rooted in increased health risks associated with older individuals. It's important to note that this doesn't make travel insurance unattainable for older individuals. </li>
            </ul>
